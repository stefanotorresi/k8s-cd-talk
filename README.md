# From 0 to Continuous Deployment with Kubernetes, Helm and GitLab CI

A live demonstration on how to get up and running from an empty directory to a fully functional application, continuously deployed to a live Kubernetes cluster, with per-branch automatic releases and manual environment promotion. Weâ€™ll be giving a short primer on Kubernetes itself, which will be the base framework for our infrastructure, an introduction to Helm, which helps to manage K8S resource manifests and install third-party components, and show how to leverage the GitLab SaaS to implement a CI/CD pipeline.
